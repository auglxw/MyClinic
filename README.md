# MyClinic

<h3>About</h3>
MyClinic is a digital Patient Registration System designed for neighbourhood GP clinics. Patients will be able to book a doctor's appointment through this web application and only head down when it is time for their appointment. This aims to improve crowd management at clinics and to improve patients' waiting experience. <br>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
During the height of the pandemic, most clinics were often very crowded and waiting time to see a doctor could take up to a few hours. Clinics' staff were faced with the challenge of managing the crowd well and patients have to bear with the long waits, which may be distressing when one is feeling unwell. Hence, this web application aims to resolve this problem by shifting the appointment booking to online.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
This full-stack web application is built using ReactJS for the frontend, Express and NodeJS for the backend and MongoDB as the database.
